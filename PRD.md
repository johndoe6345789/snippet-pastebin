- Trigger: Navigate to "Settings" via hamburger menu
- Progression: User opens settings → Selects storage backend (IndexedDB or Flask) → Configures Flask URL if needed → Tests connection → Migrates data if switching backends → Views database stats → Exports backup if needed → Can import previous backups → Manages sample data → Can clear all data if needed
- Success criteria: Backend switching works seamlessly, Flask connection test validates server availability, data migration preserves all snippets, shows accurate statistics, export creates valid .db file, import restores data correctly, clear operation requires confirmation

## Data Persistence

The application supports **flexible data storage** with two backend options:

### Storage Backends

1. **IndexedDB (Local Browser Storage) - Default**
   - Uses SQL.js (SQLite compiled to WebAssembly) for local database management
   - Primary Storage: IndexedDB - Used when available for better performance and larger storage capacity (typically 50MB+)
   - Fallback: localStorage - Used when IndexedDB is unavailable (typically 5-10MB limit)
   - Database Structure: Two tables - `snippets` (user-created snippets) and `snippet_templates` (reusable templates)
   - Automatic Persistence: Database is automatically saved after every create, update, or delete operation
   - Export/Import: Users can export their entire database as a .db file for backup or transfer

2. **Flask Backend (Remote Server) - Optional**
   - Snippets stored on a Flask REST API server with SQLite database
   - Allows access to snippets from any device
   - Requires running the Flask backend (Docker support included)
   - RESTful API endpoints for all CRUD operations
   - Data migration tools to move snippets between IndexedDB and Flask

### Switching Between Backends

Users can switch storage backends from the Settings page:
- Select desired backend (IndexedDB or Flask)
- Configure Flask URL if using remote backend
- Test connection to Flask server
- Migrate existing snippets between backends
- Configuration persists in localStorage

This approach provides:
- Full SQL query capabilities for complex filtering and sorting
- Choice between local-only or remote storage
- Reliable persistence across browser sessions
- Easy backup and restore functionality
- Protection against localStorage quota exceeded errors
- Multi-device access when using Flask backend

## Edge Case Handling
- **No Search Results**: Friendly message encouraging users to refine their search
- **Duplicate Titles**: Allow duplicates, use unique IDs for management
- **Empty States**: Display helpful guidance when no snippets exist
- **Navigation on Mobile**: Hamburger menu adapts with full-screen overlay on small devices
- **Storage Quota Exceeded**: Automatically switches from localStorage to IndexedDB if available, warns user if both are full
- **Database Corruption**: Gracefully handles corrupted database files, creates new database if loading fails
- **Import Invalid Database**: Validates imported files, shows clear error message if file is invalid
- **Flask Connection Failure**: Tests connection before switching to Flask backend, shows clear error if server is unreachable
- **Data Migration Errors**: Validates data during migration, provides clear feedback on success or failure
- **Network Errors with Flask**: Shows informative error messages when Flask API calls fail, suggests checking server status

## Design Direction
The design should evoke **precision, technical craftsmanship, and modern developer tools**.

## Color Selection

Color scheme approach: Deep, sophisticated dark theme with vibrant purple accents and cyan highlights for a technical, modern aesthetic.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Purple `oklch(0.55 0.20 280)` - Communicates creativity and technical sophistication, used for main actions and branding
- **Secondary Colors**: Dark Slate `oklch(0.28 0.04 280)` - Provides subtle contrast for secondary elements and hover states
- **Accent Color**: Vibrant Cyan `oklch(0.75 0.18 200)` - Attention-grabbing highlight for CTAs, focus states, and important elements
- **Background**: Very Dark Base `oklch(0.10 0.01 280)` - Deep foundation that reduces eye strain and emphasizes content
- **Card/Surface**: Elevated Slate `oklch(0.18 0.02 280)` - Distinguishes content areas from background
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Dark Base oklch(0.10 0.01 280)): Foreground (oklch(0.96 0.01 280)) - Ratio 9.2:1 ✓
  - Card (Deep Slate oklch(0.18 0.02 280)): Card Foreground (oklch(0.96 0.01 280)) - Ratio 7.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Purple oklch(0.55 0.20 280)): White (oklch(0.98 0 0)) - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓
  - Accent (Cyan oklch(0.75 0.18 200)): Card Background (oklch(0.18 0.02 280)) - Ratio 6.1:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typefaces should convey **technical precision** with **modern readability**. Using Inter for UI elements (clean and highly legible) and JetBrains Mono for code (optimized for programming).

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (Page Titles): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter-spacing (-0.02em)
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter Bold/24px/tight letter-spacing (-0.01em)
  - H3 (Subsection Headers): Inter Semibold/20px/normal letter-spacing
  - Body Text: Inter Regular/16px/1.5 line-height
  - Code Text: JetBrains Mono Regular/14px/1.6 line-height
  - Small Text/Captions: Inter Regular/14px/muted color

## Animations
